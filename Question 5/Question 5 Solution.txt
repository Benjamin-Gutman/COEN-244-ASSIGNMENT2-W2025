To add a booking date, we could add another vector to the Flight class. This vector would be updated each time a passenger is added and removed from a flight.
This would require addPassenger and removePassenger updated. The addPassenger function will now take a Date object as an input and will add the Date object to the vector
associated with booking dates. Since both vectors will always be updated at the same time, the index for each vector will correspond to the same person. The removePassenger
function will now also remove the Date at the same index the Passenger was found in the passengers vector. The displayPassenger function could also be updated to display the 
day each passngers booking was made on top of the other change made to include a booking date.
